## Docker tips

If you are new to Docker lets start with the definition:

> Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications.
> Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code.
> Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.

And then go to the [UserGuide](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/).
